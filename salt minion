192.168.201.128

Configure Salt Minions
Install the package salt-minion on all salt minions after importing repository key and adding the repo:

sudo apt install salt-minion
By default a Salt Minion will try to connect to the DNS name “salt“; if the Minion is able to resolve that name correctly, no configuration is needed.


Set DNS name of the Salt Master on /etc/hosts:
192.168.201.128 salt

Set Minion ID on /etc/salt/minion_id:

oibit

Print the master key fingerprint by running the following command on the Salt master:

[root@master ~]# salt-key -F master
Local Keys:
master.pem:  74:85:d0:bd:09:86:7e:7c:5c:b9:36:1e:8c:28:58:cc:26:e8:e7:ae:8c:c6:1a:2c:34:b4:68:52:da:85:5f:6c
master.pub:  15:f7:d4:cc:c2:8b:ef:1f:4e:ba:c2:85:75:33:48:eb:a6:3e:48:00:58:b7:3c:7d:98:ca:76:33:85:15:ed:b2
Copy the master.pub fingerprint from the Local Keys section, and then set this value as the master_finger in the minion configuration file.

master_finger: '15:f7:d4:cc:c2:8b:ef:1f:4e:ba:c2:85:75:33:48:eb:a6:3e:48:00:58:b7:3c:7d:98:ca:76:33:85:15:ed:b2'
If you make any change like setting IP address of the master on /etc/salt/minion, you’ll need to restart salt-minion service:

sudo systemctl restart salt-minion
Login to the master node and check Accepted Keys:

[root@master ~]# salt-key -L
Accepted Keys:
Denied Keys:
Unaccepted Keys:
ubuntu-01
Rejected Keys:
Accept the Key on the Master

[root@master ~]# salt-key --accept='oibit'
The following keys are going to be accepted:
Unaccepted Keys:
oibit
Proceed? [n/Y] Y 
Key for minion oibit accepted.

[root@master ~]# salt-key -L
Accepted Keys:
oibit
Denied Keys:
Unaccepted Keys:
Rejected Keys:
From the output, you can confirm that the key has been added to the Accepted keys list.

You can also accept for all of the Minion servers by using the option -A:

[root@master ~]# salt-key -A
Check Minion Key Fingerprint
Run the following command on each Salt minion to view the minion key fingerprint:

# salt-call --local key.finger
Sample output

[root@oibit ~]# salt-call --local key.finger
local:
    45:b8:14:28:73:c5:fd:9f:af:21:f6:21:8e:06:3d:e6:b9:12:83:41:8a:78:3f:db:1e:19:85:d0:1d:71:be:02
Compare this value to the value that is displayed when you run the salt-key –finger <MINION_ID> command on the Salt master.

[root@master ~]# salt-key --finger ubuntu-01
Accepted Keys:
ubuntu-01:  45:b8:14:28:73:c5:fd:9f:af:21:f6:21:8e:06:3d:e6:b9:12:83:41:8a:78:3f:db:1e:19
Test Master Minion Communication
Verify the communication between the Master and a Minion by running the test.ping command:

[root@master ~]# salt ubuntu-01 test.ping
ubuntu-01:
    True
salt saltstack ping test min
To test the communication between Salt Master and all Minions use:

[root@master ~]# salt '*' test.ping
